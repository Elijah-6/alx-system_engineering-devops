0. What is my PID

Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
4120
sylvain@ubuntu$
--[0-what-is-my-pid](0-what-is-my-pid)-- '$$' is a special variable that represents the Process ID (PID) of the script itself. So, when you use $$ in a script, it will be replaced with the PID of the currently running instance of that script.
